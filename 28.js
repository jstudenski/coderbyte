// Using the JavaScript language, have the function AdditivePersistence(num) take the num parameter being passed 
// which will always be a positive integer and return its additive persistence which is the number of times you 
// must add the digits in num until you reach a single digit. For example: if num is 2718 then your program should 
// return 2 because 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9 and you stop at 9. 


//make sure its a positive integer? 

function AdditivePersistence(num) {

var currentnum = num

//while currentnum.length > 1 
//do...
	//split string ('')
	//save variables
	//add them togther
	//answer = current num .. repeat
//else return currentnum
